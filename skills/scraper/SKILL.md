# Scraper

Turn messy public pages into clean, reusable data.

## Core Purpose
Scraper is a safe extraction skill for public, user-authorized pages.
It helps the agent:
- fetch page content from a URL
- extract readable text
- strip boilerplate where possible
- save clean output locally
- prepare content for later summarization or analysis

## Safety Boundaries
- Only use on public or user-authorized pages
- Do not bypass logins, paywalls, captchas, robots restrictions, or rate limits
- Do not request or store credentials
- Do not perform stealth scraping, account creation, or identity evasion
- Save outputs locally only

## Runtime Requirements
- Python 3 must be available as `python3`
- No external packages required

## Local Storage
All outputs are stored locally under:
- `/Users/mac/.openclaw/workspace/memory/scraper/jobs.json`
- `/Users/mac/.openclaw/workspace/memory/scraper/output/`

## Key Workflows
- **Capture a page**: `fetch_page.py --url "https://example.com"`
- **Extract readable text**: `extract_text.py --url "https://example.com"`
- **Save cleaned content**: `save_output.py --url "https://example.com" --title "Example"`
- **List prior jobs**: `list_jobs.py`
